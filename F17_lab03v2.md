Eric Freilafert and Sung Kim

a) This is a basic game of Blackjack that is playable on a GUI
b) Currently, in this implementation of Blackjack, as a user, I can:
*  select the number of participating players (up to three)
*  provide names for all the participating players
*  choose an amount to bet ($25, $50, $100, $250, $500, or your own custom amount), with an initial $5000 stack
*  As a player, when it's my turn, I can click on the "hit", "stay", and, under the right conditions, "double down" buttons.
As a player, I can:
*   add money to my stack, change the bet amount, and leave the game.
*   click on a button that allows me to play again and click on another button that will allow me to save the current stats. 
c) The game runs by using the "ant run" command in the directory of the repo in the command line. This allows you to play a game of Blackjack with up to three players.
d) As a user, I should be able to:
*   choose my own avatar to represent me in the game
*   customize the playing table and playing cards
e) The README is very organized and detailed. This format should continue to be followed by teams in order for the next generation folks to have an easier time.
f) The build.xml file is in very good condition. All the targets have descriptions and there is no outdated code.
g) There are enough current "issues" to get 1000 points. The expections are very clear and succinct.
h) https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-blackjack/issues/65
i) All the methods in the code have comments that describe what the methods do. All the instance variables are declared at the top and the methods follow right after. There are only comments inside some of the methods, so some of the code is hard to understand since there are functions that aren't commonly used. The variables are named very well; I was able to quickly understand the purpose of each variable just by reading its name. The indentation for some of the functions isn't proper and could be worked on. It's easy to understand how all the classes relate to each other and what role they play in the project. The code is very modular, allowing bugs to be more easily detected and fixed.
j) In the test files, there are a lot of test cases, and all seem to be properly written. There's also a separate test file for each java class. Each test file contains 10-15 test cases, which seem to cover a lot of cases. Since there's a test file for each class, the whole project is covered by the tests. There is no tester file for the GUI, however, so the testing coverage can be expanded by testing the GUI.
