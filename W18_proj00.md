## W18_proj00 ##
(a) A one to three player vegas blackjack game, complete with money mechanics and saved statistics.

(b) 
- As a player, I should be able to play a blackjack game, so that I may enjoy wasting precious work time. 
- As a player, I can control the amount of money being bet, so that I can win virtual dollars.
- As a player, I should be able to start a game with one or two other people, so that I can play with my friends.
- As a player, I should be able to save my statistics, so that I can see how I have progressed (brag to my friends).

(c) The software does run, albeit extremely poorly. There are multiple bugs, primarily relating to the GUI, such as multiple windows being opened when only one is needed. You have the option to play with one, two, or three human controlled players, against each other/the dealer. Statistics are saved relating to your name. 

(d)
- As a player, I should be able to play against one or more AI controlled opponents, so that I can practice while my friends have fun without me.
- As a game, I should properly display information to make the UI more presentable (possibly look like a table - that would be neat)
- As a game, play multiple different background music tracks, and allow the player to choose, so that they don't have to listen to the same ambient casino music the whole time.
