### a) Project Description:

The project is an GUI based implementation of the card game Blackjack for up to 3 people on the same machine.

### b) User Stories of Current Implementation:
* As a player, I am able to play the game of blackjack.
* As a group, we can play blackjack together.
* As a player, I can change the amount that I want to bet.

### c) Does it run?

It does run, allowing up to three players can play blackjack together

### d) User Stories of Improvements:
* As a player in a group, I will be able to only see my own cards.
* As a player, I will be able to listen to music throughout my entire blackjack experience.
* As a player, I will be able to click buttons that stay in the same place as the game progresses.

### e) README.md quality?

It is good in that it states many possible improvements. However, it lacks in a detailed description of the game as is. Also, it is poorly organized; W16 clearly just took the F16 README.md and added on, without editing

### f) Current State of build.xml:
build.xml seems to be properly written with targets such as compile, run, images, clean, test, javadoc, and jar. We have also tested if it runs, so from that, we can assume the build.xml works as expected.

### g) Assessment of Current Issues:

There are plenty of current issues to add up to 1000 points worth of programming. The issues are clear on what is wrong and what the fixed state is. Noteable current issues include "Negative betting allowed", "In multiplayer, only one hand should be shown at a time", and "Refactor BlackjackGUI.java".

### h) Additional Issues:
* Music doesn't loop while the game is playing.
* Player positions on the screen should switch around when it is player's turn.

### i) Code Assessment:

The code is terrible: BlackjackGui.java is over 2000 lines long and no MVC is implemented. Game logic is in the GUI, needs to be factored into MANY different Case statements in Blackjack.java are way too big and repeat code. Functions need to be factored out. The "save" functionality needs to be moved out of Blackjack.java. The Player class is mostly good. It contains duplicate fields, such as numberOfCards and numberOfCards2. These should be combined and the logic changed. Deck.java is good, it would be better with an enum for SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS. Additionally, it would be better if it extended ArrayList instead of containing one. Hand.java is okay. Methods like "setSecondCard" and "displayHandValue" are unnecessary. In summary, each class implements things that it should not; each class needs to have one particular function.

### j) Test Coverage:
* Several tests are written for each of the classes, except for BlackjackGui, which is difficult to test, other than by playing it yourself. Therefore, we can test the GUI better by refactoring, and creating tests for smaller units.
